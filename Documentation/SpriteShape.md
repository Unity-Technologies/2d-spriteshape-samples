# <a id="Overview"></a>Overview

A **Sprite Shape** is an Asset that contains multiple Sprites assigned to specific angles. When rendered in a Scene, a Sprite Shape tiles assigned Sprites along its spline path or outline, automatically deforming and changing the Sprites displayed depending on its settings.

In this way, Sprite Shapes are powerful worldbuilding tools that allow you to construct your game world quickly and efficiently. The following examples demonstrate the different ways to construct levels using different kinds of Sprite Shapes.

<br><sub>Fig 1: Examples of level designs using **Sprite Shapes**</sub></br>

There are two parts to creating and editing Sprite Shapes, namely the **[Sprite Shape Profile](#SS-Profile)**, and the **[Sprite Shape Controller](#SS-Control)**. The **Sprite Shape Profile** contains the settings for the Sprite Shape Asset, such as all the Sprites included in the shape and the angle ranges that they are assigned to. The **Sprite Shape Controller** component allows you to edit a Sprite Shape’s outline into different shapes.

# <a id="Whatis"></a>What is a Sprite Shape Profile

To use a **Sprite Shape**, you begin by creating a **Sprite Shape Profile**. A Sprite Shape Profile is an Asset that contains the Sprites that make up the Sprite Shape, and settings such as the angles that those Sprites are displayed at. 

Go to **Assets** > **Create** > **Sprite Shape Profile**, and there are three *Profile* options available - *Empty, Strip, Shape*

The *Empty* profile is the default, and contains no preset settings or angle ranges. The *Strip* profile is a preset that prepares Sprite Shapes for long continuous segments. For example, if you want to create platforms, or background details like a tree line.

![Curved Path](images/2D_SpriteShape_010.png)
<br><sub>Fig 4: Example of Platform created from the *Strip* preset</sub>

![Curved Treeline](images/2D_SpriteShape_011.png)
<br><sub>Fig 5: Example of background treeline element created from the *Strip* preset</sub><p></p>
The *Shape* preset (see Fig 6 below) comes with 8 preset Angle Ranges. By assigning Sprites to each range, an 8-sided [closed Sprite Shape](#closed-SS) is created when the Sprite Shape is dragged onto a Scene. Rearranging or resizing the control points of this Sprite Shape causes the Sprites to react to changes in angles and [automatically switch](#MultiRange) to the correct Sprite for that angle range.

![Shape preset made platform](images/2D_SpriteShape_012.png)
<br><sub>Fig 6: An example platform created from the *Shape* preset</sub>
<p>
If a Fill texture is set, then a closed Sprite Shape also displays the Fill texture within itself. This makes closed Sprite Shapes especially useful for creating and shaping backgrounds, platforms, or other kinds of worldbuilding elements for your Project.

# <a id="CreateSSProfile"></a>Creating a Sprite Shape Profile

![Angle Ranges Tool](images/2D_SpriteShape_013.png)
<br><sub>Fig 7: The Angle Ranges tool</sub><br>

A key feature of the **Sprite Shape Profile** is the Angle Ranges tool. Assigning an Angle Range determines what Sprite is displayed at specific angles.  

## <a id="AngleRange"></a>Creating an Angle Range

1. Click the *Create Range* button at the bottom of the Angle Ranges tool.<br><br>![Create Range arrow](images/2D_SpriteShape_014.png)
<br><sub>Fig 8: ‘Create Range’ button</sub>

   - If the button is not visible, select and move the *Preview Handle* to an area without an Angle Range. The *Create Range* button should then appear. 
	![Blue preview handle](images/2D_SpriteShape_015.png)<p><sub>Fig 9: Selecting the blue Preview Handle</sub>

2.  An Angle Range is created centred on the *Preview Handle.*<br><br>![Angle Range on preview handle](images/2D_SpriteShape_016.png)<br><sub>Fig 10: Blue area shows active Angle Range</sub>

    - Another way to create an Angle Range is to hover the mouse over an empty area of the circle range. An outline appears to show the possible range.
	<br>![Angle Range outline](images/2D_SpriteShape_017.png)<br><sub>Fig 11: Creating an Angle Range on an empty space</sub><p>Left-click to create a range in the highlighted area.

	- The range covered by the currently selected Angle Range is displayed at the bottom of the tool.
	<br>![Angle Range values](images/2D_SpriteShape_018.png)<br><sub>Fig 12: Enter the respective values here</sub><p>Edit a range by entering new values into *Start* and *End*, or drag either endpoint to the desired angles. The endpoint of a range cannot be extended into a neighboring range.<p></p>
3. To delete an Angle Range, select the range then press the **Del/Delete** key.

## <a id="AssignSprite"></a>Assigning Sprites

After creating an **Angle Range**, the next step is to assign Sprites to that range.

![Sprite List](images/2D_SpriteShape_019.png)<br><sub>Fig 13: The empty default Sprite List</sub>

Beneath the Angle Ranges tool is the **Sprites** list that shows all the Sprites currently assigned to that range.

![Add row](images/2D_SpriteShape_020.png)
<br><sub>Fig 14: Adding a Sprite row to the list</sub>

To add Sprites to the list, click the **+** icon to insert a new row and Sprite to the list.  Click the circle icon next to the empty row to open the **Object Picker** window, which displays all available Sprites in the project.

![Drag drop to row](images/2D_SpriteShape_021.png)
<br><sub>Fig 15: Dragging a Sprite onto a row</sub>

Another way to add Sprites is to simply drag a Sprite onto a row to add it. A single Angle Range can have multiple Sprites assigned to it, one per row. Only the Sprite at the top of the list is displayed by default. The other Sprites in the list are displayed by changing to their respective **[Sprite Index](#sprite-index)** numbers in the **Sprite Shape Controller** settings. 

Drag the leftmost ends of the rows up or down to reorder them. Changing the order of the Sprite rows also changes their respective **Sprite Index** number. 

## <a id="MultiRange"></a>Preview Multiple Angle Ranges

After creating multiple Angle Ranges and assigning different Sprites, you can preview the Sprites as they appear at their assigned angles by rotating the Preview Handle around the tool. 

![Angle preview 1](images/2D_SpriteShape_022.png)
<br><sub>Fig 16: Sprites are displayed within the Angle Range they are assigned to</sub><br></br><br></br>
![Angle preview 2](images/2D_SpriteShape_023.png)
<br><sub>Fig 17: Rotate the Preview Handle to preview the assigned Sprites at each angle</sub>

# <a id="OpenEnd"></a>Open-Ended Sprite Shapes

The *Strip* preset is ideal to create continuous platforms (see Fig 18). These Sprite Shapes can be extended or deformed as needed for your Project, with the Sprites automatically tiling along the spline path.<p>![Example repeat](images/2D_SpriteShape_024.png)<br><sub>Fig 18: Sprite Shape forming a continuous platform along the spline path</sub>

1. First, prepare the base Sprite correctly before it is used into the Sprite Shape Profile.<br>![Base Sprite](images/2D_SpriteShape_025.png)<p><sub>Fig 19: The original Sprite</sub><p>Import the Sprite into the Project, and open the [Sprite Editor](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SpriteEditor.html) to edit its borders.<p>![Sprite Editing borders](images/2D_SpriteShape_026.png)<br><sub>Fig 20: Creating borders in the Sprite Editor</sub><p>The Sprite border appears as a green outline along the edges of the Sprite. Click and drag the Control Points of the border to change its size and shape. Divide the Sprite into 3 sections - a middle section that will be repeatedly tiled, and two sections that border the middle to act as bookends.<p>With the *Strip* preset settings, the middle section is tiled along the spline path, and both ends of the Sprite Shape can be capped by the left and right sections defined in Fig 20.<p>Select **Apply** to save these new Sprite borders.

2. Exit the **Sprite Editor** and create a new **Sprite Shape Profile** with the *Strip* preset.<p>![image alt text](images/2D_SpriteShape_027.png)<br><sub>Fig 21: Default Sprite Shape profile for the *Strip* Preset</sub>

3. Assign a Sprite to the **Angle Range**.<p>![Strip Sprite](images/2D_SpriteShape_028.png)<br><sub>Fig 22: The assigned Sprite appears for all angles in 360° range</sub><p>Click and drag the Preview Handle to see how the same Sprite is displayed at every angle in its full 360° range. This means that no matter which angle the Sprite Shape’s, the Sprite is displayed as a continuous tiling pattern that looks like a platform. 

4. Ensure that *Use Sprite Borders* is checked in the **Sprite Shape Profile** settings.<p>![Use Sprite Borders](images/2D_SpriteShape_029.png)<br><sub>Fig 23: Use *Sprite Borders* must be checked</sub><p>This ensures that the left and right segments defined in Step 2 bookend the endpoints of the Sprite Shape, creating a visually complete platform.

5. Drag the **Sprite Shape Profile** into the Scene to create a Sprite Shape GameObject based on the Profile settings.<p>![Dragging into Scene](images/2D_SpriteShape_030.png)<br><sub>Fig 24: Sprite Shape Asset is brought into the Scene</sub><p>To continue editing the Sprite Shape within the Scene, you need to adjust the settings in the **[Sprite Shape Controller](#UseSS-Control)** component. It is automatically attached to the Sprite Shape once it is dragged into the Scene or Hierarchy.

# <a id="closed-SS"></a>Closed Sprite Shapes

Use closed Sprite Shapes ton construct large sections of a level that contains a Fill texture, such as a background wall or a large platform.

![Closed Sprite Shape](images/2D_SpriteShape_039.png)<br><sub>Fig 25: Closed Sprite Shape, with automatic *Corners* and a *Fill* texture enabled</sub><p>Create a closed Sprite Shape by clearing the *Open Ended* checkbox in the **Sprite Shape Controller** options (see Fig 26). This causes the two endpoints of an open-ended Sprite Shape to automatically connect and form a closed shape.

![Clear checkbox](images/2D_SpriteShape_040.png)<br><sub>Fig 26: The *Open Ended* checkbox</sub>

Constructing a closed Sprite Shape allows it to use additional Sprite Shape features such as automatic *Corners* and displaying a *Fill* textures.

# <a id="UseSS-Control"></a>The Sprite Shape Controller Settings

To edit the Spline path and shape of a **Sprite Shape**, click the *Edit Spline* button to make the Spline path and its Control Points become visible and editable.<p>
![Enable Spline](images/2D_SpriteShape_031.png)<br><sub>Fig 27: *Edit Spline*</sub>

Once **Edit Spline** is enabled, you can do the following:

1. Add additional Control Points by clicking anywhere along the spline path.<p>
![Adding Control Point](images/2D_SpriteShape_032.png)<br><sub>Fig 28: Control point</sub>

2. Select and move Control Points to adjust the shape and length of the spline path.<p>
![Moving a Control Point](images/2D_SpriteShape_033.png)<br><sub>Fig 29: Set Control Point to Mirrored Mode to make curves</sub>

3. Change the **[Point Mode](#point-mode)** of the selected Control Point.

4. Set the **[Sprite Index](#sprite-index)** number of the selected Control Point.

5. Set the **[Corner](#AssignCorners)** setting to *Automatic* or *Disabled* for the selected Control Point.

## <a id="point-mode"></a>Point Modes

When a Control Point is selected, its **Point Mode** can be changed into one of 3 modes- *Linear*, *Mirrored*, and *Non-Mirrored*. 

**Point Modes** control the behavior of tangent lines on the selected Control Point. These tangents control the shape of the curve between them, and affects how the Sprites between Control Points are deformed. Each Control Point in a Sprite Shape has its own unique Point Mode settings.

### Linear Point Mode
In *Linear* Point Mode, there are no tangent lines to control the curve between the Control Point and its neighbors. When a Control Point and its immediate neighbors are **all** set to *Linear* Point mode, the corners between them can only be rounded via the *Bevel Cutoff* and *Bevel Size* settings.

![Linear point mode](images/2D_SpriteShape_034.png)<br><sub>Fig 30: *Linear Point Mode*</sub>

The *Bevel* settings are ignored if any of the Control Point's immediate neighbors is set to a non-*Linear* Point Mode.

![Smooth bevelled curves](images/2D_SpriteShape_035.png)<br><sub>Fig 31: Corner rounded by Bevel settings (note that Sprite Borders are not displayed with Bevels)</sub>

The Control Point first refers to the *Bevel Cutoff* and *Bevel Size* settings in the original **Sprite Shape Profile** Asset. Adjusting the same settings in the **Sprite Shape Controller** from their default of 0 causes them to override the original Profile settings.

### Mirrored/Non-Mirrored Point Mode

In these two modes, tangent lines appear on either side of the selected Control Point, and the *Bevel Cutoff* and *Bevel Size* settings are ignored.

![Non-mirrored](images/2D_SpriteShape_036.png)<br><sub>Fig 32: Control Point in Non-Mirrored Point Mode</sub>

Adjusting the tangents controls the curve of the spline between a selected Control Point and its neighbors.

## <a id="sprite-index"></a>Sprite Index

The *Sprite Index* number determines what Sprite is shown in between two Control Points. The number refers to a row on the Sprites list, and the Sprite assigned to that row.

### Adding to the Sprite Index List

![Adding to Sprite Index](images/2D_SpriteShape_037.png)<br><sub>Fig 33: Multiple rows in *Sprites List*</sub>

To add additional Sprites to the Sprites list, open the **Sprite Shape Profile** to find the list of Sprites currently assigned to the Sprite Shape under the Angle Ranges tool.

Click the + icon to add another row to the list. Add a Sprite to the list by dragging it onto the empty row. Clicking the circle icon on the right opens the Object Picker window and allows you to select an available Sprite as well.

The Sprite at the top of the list is the default Sprite displayed by the Sprite Shape at Sprite Index 0. The next Sprite in the list given index number 1, and so on.

### Changing the Sprite Index Number 

![Changing Index number](images/2D_SpriteShape_038.png)<br><sub>Fig 34: *Sprite Index* slider and field</sub>

To display a different a Sprite at a Control Point:

1. View the **Sprite Shape Controller** component settings of the selected **Sprite Shape**.

2. Check the *Edit Spline* option, and select a Control Point.  

3. Adjust the Control Point’s *Sprite Index* setting with the slider, or enter the index value. Note that setting the Sprite Index number to one that doesn’t exist in the Sprite List displays the default Sprite.

## <a id="AssignCorners"></a>Corners

The *Corners* settings displays the list of Sprites that are currently assigned to their respective corners (see Fig 35 below). These Sprites are automatically assigned if the *Corner* setting in the **Sprite Shape Controller** is set to *Automatic*.

![Corners list](images/2D_SpriteShape_041.png)<br><sub>Fig 35: Corner settings in the **Sprite Shape Profile**</sub>

When the Sprite Shape is rendered in the Scene, the assigned Sprites are displayed at the respective corners (see Fig 36).

Note that a corner Sprite is only displayed if the Control Point and its neighbors are all in *Linear Point Mode*.

![Labelled corners](images/2D_SpriteShape_042.png)<br><sub>Fig 36: Corresponding Corners automatically generated on the Sprite Shape</sub>

## <a id="fill-Sprite"></a>Fill

![Fill texture](images/2D_SpriteShape_043.png)<br><sub>Fig 37: *Fill* settings in the **Sprite Shape Profile**</sub>

In the **Sprite Shape Profile**, you can select a texture that automatically fills any closed Sprite Shape derived from the same **Sprite Shape Profile.** This setting has no effect if the Spline is set to *Open Ended*.

The *Pixel Per Unit* setting allows you to scale the Fill texture, while the *Offset* slider allows the Fill texture to bleed out or retract from the edges of the Sprite Shape if needed.

Enabling the *World Space UV* setting causes the Fill texture to refer to the World Space UV, instead of per Object UV. By default, *World Space UV* is disabled, and each Sprite Shape’s Fill texture refers to its own Object UV (see Fig 37).

![Per object UV](images/2D_SpriteShape_044.png)<br><sub>Fig 37: Two Sprite Shapes from the same **Sprite Shape Profile**, *World Space UV* unchecked</sub>

![World UV](images/2D_SpriteShape_045.png)<br><sub>Fig 38: Same Sprite Shapes, with *World Space UV* enabled</sub>

With *World Space UV* enabled, Sprite Shapes derived from the same **Sprite Shape Profile** appear to overlay a single large Fill texture that spans the entire layer instead.

# <a id="collision"></a>Enabling Collision

To enable your Sprite Shape to respond to 2D physics, attach a **Collider 2D** component to the Sprite Shape.

![Component List](images/2D_SpriteShape_046.png)<br><sub>Fig 39: List of Collider 2D components</sub> 

All Collider 2D components can be used, except for the *Tilemap Collider 2D*. However, the **Sprite Shape Controller’s** Collider properties are only available if either a *Polygon Collider 2D* or *Edge Collider 2D* is attached.

![Polygon default colllider](images/2D_SpriteShape_047.png)<br><sub>Fig 40: Polygon Collider 2D green outline over Sprite Shape</sub>

When first attached, the Collider’s mesh and outline do not match the Sprite Shape (see Fig 40). To automatically match the Collider mesh to the Sprite Shape, go to the Sprite Shape Controller’s *Collider* settings (see Fig 41), and check the *Update Collider* checkbox.

![Match](images/2D_SpriteShape_048.png)<br><sub>Fig 41: *Update Collider *automatically edits the Collider outline to match the Sprite Shape</sub>

To make manual edits to the Collider mesh, go to the component’s settings and enable *Edit Collider* to move and create the Collider mesh’s control points (see Fig 42).

![Edit Collider](images/2D_SpriteShape_049.png)<br><sub>Fig 42: Editing the Collider mesh manually</sub>

Note that Colliders are unique to each instance of the **Sprite Shape Profile** in the Scene. To duplicate a Collider mesh, you must duplicate the entire Sprite Shape object it is attached to as well.
